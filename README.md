## How to Play

If you are familiar with the rules of the popular online game "Wordle" then you know the rules for Savvy Speed Words. However, be aware that the color scheme is different. Correct letters are pink, letters that are in the incorrect position are blue, and letters that are not in the word are gray.

### `Rules`

- You have 6 tries to correctly guess the random word.
- Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word, otherwise an error message will be displayed. If your word is invalid, you can delete letters and retry entering the word.
- The color of the boxes will show you whether your letter was in the correct position, in the wrong position, or not in the word at all.

Example:

![Game Screenshot](./src/images/colorsScreenshot.png)

- Letter A is in the correct position (PINK)
- Letters L and N are in the word, but in the wrong position (BLUE)
- Letters E and R are not in the word (GRAY)

The game either ends when you correctly guess the number of words that you chose to solve (1, 3, 5, or 10) or you fail to guess a word within 6 tries.

If you chose to guess more than 1 word, then after you correctly guess the first word, a new random word will be chosen and you will have to guess it. This continues until you have solved the number of words that you chose.

### `Typing`

- In order to type your letters you can either use your keyboard or the one provided within the app.
- Use the "Backspace" or "Delete" Keys to delete a letter if using your keyboard.
- Click "Enter" to submit your word.
